# Bayesian Network Engine

## 1. Introduction

This project is an exploration into  Bayesian networks, aiming to create a robust engine for reasoning and approximating probabilities. The implementation is crafted in C++ with the primary goal of expanding my proficiency in this programming language.

## 2. Motivation

Bayesian Networks are really fascinating for exploring the impact of certain events on other events. They allow for better understanding of the dependancies of certain events and the longterm impact of events at the beginning of the network on the ending nodes.
